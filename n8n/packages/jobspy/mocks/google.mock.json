      "description": "About Us:\n\nWe're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.\n\nWe've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.\n\nNotion is an in-person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).\n\nAbout The Role:\n\nMobile devices have reshaped personal computing—the power of a desktop now fits in our pockets. By giving everyone the building blocks to create their own tools, we'll solve more problems wherever we go. A delightful, intuitive mobile experience: that's our guiding light, and we need iOS engineers to make it a reality.\n\nWhat You'll Achieve:\n• You’ll work with a team of engineers and cross-functional partners across product, design, data science, and user research to build and maintain product features for our iOS app\n• We value building high quality apps. You'll improve the performance, reliability, and polish of our iOS app. You will also get to work within the web stack to improve the mobile editor.\n• You'll help build and improve internal tools with simplicity and productivity in mind. For example, you might write a script that makes it easier to deploy new versions of our apps.\n• Notion is a multi product company, you’ll help make this a sustainable reality on mobile. For example, you might work with Notion Mail to launch the first version of their iOS app.\n\nSkills You'll Need to Bring:\n• Thoughtful problem-solving: For you, problem-solving starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You can decompose tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates. You're comfortable asking for help when you get stuck.\n• Ability to ship quality apps at scale: You have 6+ years of experience working with a team to build and maintain quality iOS apps for a large audience. You're familiar with Swift or Objective-C and have handled UI, networking, and threading in those languages.\n• Willingness to learn and work on multiple tech stacks: While we are primarily looking for iOS expertise, this role will require willingness to learn and work on the web stack (Typescript, React).\n• Pragmatic and business-oriented: You care about the business impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You're not just going after cool stuff—you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line.\n• Put users first: You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad.\n• Not ideological about technology: To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go.\n• Empathetic communication: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed.\n• Team player: You understand when work is better, together. You enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals, and you care about learning, growing, and helping others to do the same.\n\nNice to Haves:\n• You’ve built and published your own iOS apps before.\n• You're proficient with our technology stack: Swift, SwiftUI, React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Postgres.\n• You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work.\n• You have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or social sciences.\n\nWe hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.\n\nNotion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic. Notion considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law. Notion is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures. If you need assistance or an accommodation due to a disability, please let your recruiter know. Notion is committed to providing highly competitive cash compensation, equity, and benefits.
